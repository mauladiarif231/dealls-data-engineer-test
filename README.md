# Dealls Senior Data Engineer Technical Test

This repository contains solutions for the Senior Data Engineer technical test at Dealls. The test consists of three case studies:

1. **SQL Queries** (file: `Case-Study-SQL-Query.py`)
2. **Data Replication using Python** (file: `Python-Data-Replication.ipynb`)
3. **Data Export to Google Sheets** (file: `Python Data Export.ipynb`)

Additionally, the output from the Google Sheets export and file parquet is provided as a link.

## 1. SQL Queries

### Description:
The `Case-Study-SQL-Query.py` script contains SQL queries that perform data analysis tasks based on the provided dataset.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install DuckDB if needed:
    ```bash
    pip install duckdb
    ```
3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python Case-Study-SQL-Query.py
    ```

## 2. Data Replication with Python

### Description:
The `Python-Data-Replication.ipynb` notebook replicates data from a source, transforms it, and writes it to another format.

### How to Run:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the `Python-Data-Replication.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the notebook and follow the steps to perform the data replication process.

## 3. Data Export to Google Sheets

### Description:
The `Python Data Export.ipynb` notebook exports a dataset to Google Sheets and performs aggregation tasks. The output is available as a [Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LJLRE8PFSS0Wc2Ga0b8uOw8RAhipdLWPUFNYDtjiHHU/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

### How to Run:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the `Python Data Export.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the notebook's instructions to install necessary dependencies and authenticate with Google Sheets API and Google Drive API.
4. Run the notebook to export the data to the specified Google Sheet.
